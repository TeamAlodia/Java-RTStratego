VPOnline

Concept:
Monster training deck game. 
We take the Virtual Pets concept and create something akin to Virtual Pets Online: a deployable webapp that allows many users to connect to it, raise monsters and battle them in asynchronous combat. It's database heavy, reasonably familiar, includes some basic networking and uses a general concept we're familiar with.

Proper multiplayer and networking can be further down the line, in other months when we're actually learning the associated concepts. Furthermore, while Java can handle multiplayer networking, it seems to be far, far from the first choice, and many of the resources it can make use of are either outdated or designed specifically for Android. Firebase, for example. (edited)

As it is, I deeply suspect that we would have neither the learned skills to diagnose problems in networking code, nor the general experience in writing it necessary to create proper code in the first place. Not in four days, with the additional goal of strapping an actual game onto it. (edited)

I'm going to throw some time down this VPO concept today. I have a few ideas to differentiate it. And Zach, you'll be happy to know there's a hook. Think Virtual Pets, but with each pet as a deck that earns new cards as it levels up.

Multiple card types, some neutral and available to all, others specific to types. Three cards upon leveling a monster: one neutral, two specific. Multi-types get one neutral, and one of each type. (edited)

Monster happiness influences maximum deck size, while monster health translates directly into HP.

Interacting with your monster gives it a small amount of experience. Winning battles or attacking another player without contest grants more.

Players can only attack other players within a certain level range.

Each monster can initiate battle only once a day, to prevent spamming. (edited)

The max level of a monster should have the same cards as another monster of that level, maxed. Furthermore, a third type of card can be made: monster-specific, in addition to type-specific and neutral.

And monsters you own should be able to build their deck out of all non-monster specific cards available.
